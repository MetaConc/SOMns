# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

 - Revised design of promises and implemented erroring/breaking of promises
   ([PR #118](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/118))

 - Added trace replay functionality ([PR #109](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/109))
   - Added `-r` flag to enable replay

 - Added actor assertions
   - Added `-ea` flag to enable actor assertions

 - Added `-vmd` flag to enable debug output
 - Added `-J` flag for JVM flags, e.g. `-JXmx2g`
 - Removed Truffle Debug REPL support, i.e., the `-td` flag. Has been deprecated
   in Truffle for a long time, and maintaining it seems not useful.
 - Updated to Truffle 0.24+patches, from pre-0.22+patches
 - Visualize all types of activities in system view ([PR #116](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/116))
 - Block methods are named based on outer method's name
 - Enable display of code for unsuspended activities, i.e., activities not
   hitting a breakpoint


## [0.2.0] - 2017-03-07 Extended Concurrency Support

### Concurrency Support

 - Added basic support for shared-memory multithreading and fork/join
   programming ([PR #52](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/52))
   - object model uses now a global safepoint to synchronize layout changes
   - array strategies are not safe yet

 - Added Lee and Vacation benchmarks ([PR #78](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/78))

 - Configuration flag for actor tracing, -atcfg=<config>
   example: -atcfg=mt:mp:pc turns off message timestamps, message parameters and promises

 - Added Validation benchmarks and a new Harness.

 - Added basic Communicating Sequential Processes support.
   See [PR #84](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/88).

 - Added CSP version of PingPong benchmark.

 - Added simple STM implementation. See `s.i.t.Transactions` and [PR #81](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/81) for details.
 
 - Added breakpoints for channel operations in [PR #99](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/81).

 - Fixed isolation issue for actors. The test that an actor is only created
   from a value was broken ([issue #101](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/issues/101), [PR #102](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/102))

 - Optimize processing of common single messages by avoiding allocation and
   use of object buffer ([issue #90](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/90))

### Interpreter Improvements

 - Turn writes to method arguments into errors. Before it was leading to 
   confusing setter sends and 'message not understood' errors.
 
 - Simplified AST inlining and use objects to represent variable info to improve
   details displayed in debugger ([PR #80](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/80)).

 - Make instrumentation more robust by defining number of arguments of an
   operation explicitly.
  
 - Add parse-time specialization of primitives. This enables very early 
   knowledge about the program, which might be unreliable, but should be good
   enough for tooling. (See [Issue #75](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/issues/75) and [PR #88](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/88))

 - Added option to show methods after parsing in IGV with
   `-im`/`--igv-parsed-methods` ([issue #110](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/110))
